# Colin Teal
### Fascinated by the front end. Passionate about platforms. Web worker.

A full stack software engineer, with particular focus on front end web application development, in Seattle, WA with over 16 years of professional experience.

Most recently, I helped modernize and migrate [Rival IQ](https://github.com/rivaliq) from Backbone and Marionette to functional React as a _Staff Software Engineer_. Though I'm most proficient in JavaScript (JS) and accoutrement, like HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), I've dabbled in Python, PHP, C#, and C++. In my free time, I like building software with Lisp (Clojure/Script) and Scheme (Chez Scheme).

To date, my most successful and interesting personal project is a ClojureScript micro-blogging platform, still used daily by friends and family, called [Zot World](https://github.com/crteal/zot-world).

You may find me these days [trying to create podcasting tools](https://github.com/space-travel), [building a private cloud media player](https://github.com/four-clefs), or [tinkering on a simple, no-server podcast player](https://github.com/birdduck/castaway). I also help friends with small businesses meet their software needs. Nascent game development ambitions have led me to start playing with Blender and Godot, though there's nothing quite ready to share.

If I am not there, I could be chasing two children throughout the house, in the kitchen baking naturally leavened bread (like [this focaccia](https://crteal.com/recipes/focaccia.html)), jamming on music/mixes (like [this Halloween party mix](https://crteal.com/music/now-that-s-what-i-call-halloween-2023)), or writing [speculative fiction](https://www.gloom.space/episodes/the-ossuarian) of dubious quality.
